Run BeamStreamPlay under Heroku Cedar stack on port 9000
=======================================

vagrant up   


After chef run is finally complete...it still takes more than a couple minutes to load the app's dependencies....view the log to see why (below)

After the server is up, port forwarding is set up so that you can see BeamStream at http://localhost:9000


Rebuild vm
==================

vagrant destroy -f #to kill your vm
vagrant up #to recreate vm



See log for BeamStream
=============================

vagrant ssh -c "tail -f /var/log/beamstream.log"
